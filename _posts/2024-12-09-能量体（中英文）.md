**The emptiness and perceptiveness of Buddha nature (3)**

- **Energy Body**

The third tathata of Buddha nature: **Energy Body**

Energy body is composed by seventy-two thousand energy tubes of Qi and Pulse and every energy tube starts from the top of the head and this spot is called Fan Point. These Qi and Pulse are like roots and branches of plants stretching to every part of the body.

Distracting thought is the stumbling block which prevents universal energy to enter the body. As less universal energy enters the body, the energy in the energy tubes will be exhausted. Then there will be etheric holes in the energy body and the etheric holes will gradually cause illnesses of the body. In other words, the cause of all illnesses is lack of energy of the etheric body.

During sitting-meditation, we can get plenty of universal energy. Universal energy circulates in all energy tubes of the energy body. The powerful velocity potential of universal energy can cleanse all etheric holes and after the etheric holes are cleansed, we get rid of illnesses. When energy starts to flow at the Fan point, there will be heavy feeling in our head and whole body. When the energy tube of a specific area is being cleansed, there will be itchy or painful feelings in the body. Sometimes different parts of the body will feel pain. There is no need to take medicine for this kind of pain. Do more sitting-meditation and all painful feelings will disappear naturally. The spirituality will gradually have the same frequency as the information and energy of the universe, harmonize and accommodate the information and energy of time and space of all directions and the Tai Body, the real body of Buddha will therefore be developed.

**能量体**

能量体是由七万二千个气脉能量管所组成的，每一个能量管都由头顶的部位出发，這個部位叫做梵穴，这些气脉像植物的根和枝桠一样，伸展到全身的每一个部位和轮脉。

人的杂念是阻挡宇宙能量进入身体的绊脚石。进入身体的宇宙能量变少，能量管里的能量就会耗尽，然后，能量体就会出现以太破洞，以太破洞逐渐导致身体的疾病，换言之，所有疾病的肇因是因为以太体缺乏能量所致。

禅坐的时候，我们可以获得充沛的宇宙能量，宇宙能量在能量体内的所有能量管内流通，宇宙能量强大的流势可以清洗所有的以太破洞，以太破洞清洗干净以后，我们就摆脱了疾病。能量开始在梵穴流动的时候，我们的头部或全身会有沉重的感觉，某一特定区域的能量管清洗干净的时候，身体会有刺痒或疼痛的感觉，有时候，身体的不同部位都会感到疼痛，这种疼痛不须要吃药，多做一些静坐之后，所有的疼痛感会自然消失，灵性为渐与宇宙同频而通融十方时空的信息能量，太体真身由此而成。
